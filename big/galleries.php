    <p>It seems that more and more web content comes in the form of images. Just browsing around the web, you are sure to find sites that lead with a large, impressive image, one that changes to another after a few seconds or upon interaction with some basic slideshow controls. These can be designed with basic web scripting from scratch, like the examples provided by 
<a href=”https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_slideshow.asp” target="_blank" >W3Schools</a> 
Or by 
<a href=”https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-a-slideshow/” target=”_blank”>FreeCodeCamp</a></p>

<p>There are slideshow creators such as <a href=”https://www.creatopy.com/make/slideshow/ target=”_blank”>Creatopy</a> and <a href=”https://www.cincopa.com/media-platform/services/create-slideshow#tab=slider” target=”_blank”>Cincopa</a>. </p>

<p>There are also many premade galleries to choose from, like the <a href=”https://simplelightbox.com/” target=”_blank”>Simple LightBox Plugin</a> or one from <a href=”http://chocolat.insipi.de/” target=”_blank”>Chocolat</a> that can be used as is or perhaps repurposed as a banner slider. </p>

<p>Is it still safe to call it an HTML “Document” anymore? Of course it is, because it is still the content that matters. When designing a website, the ultimate goal is conversion. Will these countless options for sliders and carousels help you or your client in the big picture (pun intended)? Some people say not necessarily, and still others strongly oppose the use of sliders on your website. </p>

<p>Tom Bowen of Web Site Optimizers provides an in-depth look into <a href=”https://www.orbitmedia.com/blog/rotating-sliders-hurt-website/” target=”_blank”>whether or not sliders and carousels are good for your website</a>, and much of the data and anecdotal evidence says that sliders are, at best, ineffective from a user experience and conversion standpoint. In the article, Bowen conveys how people often skip the slider completely in their interaction with the website, because they report that they often seem like advertisements. In some cases, completely removing the slider or carousel actually increased conversion rates, perhaps due to a less distracting web page or more clear placement of important elements.</p>  

<p>There is some evidence in Bowen’s article that indicates a well designed and optimized carousel can be beneficial, so if you are inclined to throw some big, beautiful pictures on your homepage, test it out and determine what may work best for you or your client. Some simple points made are to not automatically scroll through the images, provide clear and simple navigation controls, and make transitions quick and not actually “slide” through the images. </p>

<p>From a visual design perspective, of course, it’s hard to resist a visually stunning, dynamic and interactive slideshow that you, the designer, built and curated. But according to Lee Duddell in an almost withering <a href=”https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/10312/are-carousels-effective” target=”_blank”>Stack Exchange post:</a>, “Carousels are effective at being able to tell people in marketing/senior management that their latest idea is now on the home page.” </p>
