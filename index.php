			<p>I am currently a student of web development at Seattle Central College. 
			I have been interested in programming since early 2020, 
            and I've worked on various small projects throughout my time at school.</p>
			<p>After years of slinging salads, toasting toast and roasting roasts, 
			I have turned away from the life of late nights cooking toward a new life of late nights coding.</p>
			<p>I have enjoyed learning new skills and familiarizing myself with this world,
			and I look forward to meeting more people and working on more projects as my studies continue.</p>
			<p>Specifically, my interests indlude front-end design, user experience, and some Python programming.</p>
			<p>Outside the realm of web development, I enjoy cycling, music and cooking.</p>
